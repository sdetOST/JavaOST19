	A bug which cannot be reproducible, how do you handle that ?
	
	Focusing on non-reproducible bug demands a careful approach and patience. 
	First of all, I would document the steps and repeat them under different 
	environment to find it again.The bug may not appear on some other machine 
	with similar configurations. A bug may change due to change in the test or 
	work environment and so it may not be reproduced.  Test environment should 
	be the same. 
	Mismatch of version or configuration can result in issues that are difficult 
	to reproduce in other setups. 
	I would compare the environment logs and the software debugger logs before 
	and after noticing such bugs. 
	I also would examine the test data and modify test inputs to reproduce the bug. 
	I would capture all the available Test Execution Results. This includes my test data, 
	screen shots, applications logs, system logs, server logs. 
	Screenshots and documentation are very important for evidence. 
	I also would communicate with my entire team about this issue.
